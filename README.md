# 🚢 Day 2 – Titanic Dataset: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Objective:
Perform detailed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset using statistics and visualizations to extract patterns, trends, and relationships.

---

## ✅ Tasks Completed:
- 📊 Generated summary statistics (mean, median, std, etc.)
- 🧹 Identified null values and data types
- 📉 Plotted histograms and boxplots for numeric features
- 🧠 Visualized feature relationships using pairplots & heatmaps
- 🔍 Explored survival rates by gender, class, and fare
- ✍️ Made basic feature-level inferences from visuals

---

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used:
- 🐍 Python
- 📦 Pandas, NumPy
- 📈 Matplotlib, Seaborn

---

## 📊 Key Visuals Included:
- Age & Fare Distribution (Histograms)
- Age vs Survival (Boxplot)
- Survival by Gender and Class (Countplot)
- Correlation Heatmap
- Pairplot for Feature Interactions

---

## 💡 Insights Gained:
- ✅ Females and 1st Class passengers had higher survival rates
- 💸 Higher fares were linked to better survival chances
- 🚢 Most passengers embarked from port **'S'**
- 📏 Age column had mild skewness and missing values
- 🤝 Strong correlation between Fare, Class, and Survival
